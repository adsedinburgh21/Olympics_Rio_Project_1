## Rio Olympics 2016

Itâ€™s the Olympic Games in Rio this year! The organising body want you to help them out with an important feature for their website. They are looking for an app that will track the Nations, Athletes and results of Events.

They would like to make it possible to add an Athlete, which will have an associated Nation. Event results should keep track of the athlete who got gold, silver and bronze as well as the event they participated in.

They would ideally like:

- Nation medal results table with
	- gold, silver and bronze count for each nation
	- total points for each nation based on:
		- 5 for Gold
		- 3 for Silver
		- 1 for Bronze
- Be able to add an Athlete, Nation and Event result.   (REST)
 
Further functionality would be
- CRUD actions for Athlete, Nation and event results
- Listing of each event with the medalists
- Create route that sends down nation results data as JSON
